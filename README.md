## Description
I motivated to create this project because I understand how overwhelming it maybe for a large business to keep track of their employees names, roles, salaries, departments, and mangers.
For that reason, I decided to created an application using MySql for database development.  
With MySql, a larger business can view a current roster of their employees that is easily trackable and understandable. I learned how to build and organize tables. I also learned how to properly use MySql when rendering information from the database created.
